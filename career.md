### Open positions

We always look for enthusiastic and succesfull PhD candidates with excellent grades, a passion for science and research and very good communication and technical skills. A master degree in computer science, applied mathematics or a related field is required.

Interested candidates should send (i) a CV, (ii) a motivation letter, and (ii) if applicable, a copy of a published paper or masters thesis to
[yatirisARG@gmail.com](mailto:yatirisARG@gmail.com) with "PhD Application" in the subject line.

If you are an international student, have in mind that PhD positions in Argentina are funded through scholarships granted by third-party institutions
such as [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/?lan=en) or [CIC-PBA](https://www.gba.gob.ar/cic). In that case, an application has to be fullfil and submitted, and the PhD position is only granted in case the scholarship is granted.
