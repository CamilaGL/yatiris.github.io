**Project leader:** José Ignacio Orlando, PhD (CONICET - PLADEMA/UNICEN) <br>
**Team:** Tomás Castilla, Lautaro Gramuglia, Leandro Roccamora. <br>
**Our clinical partners:** Hospital El Cruce (Florencio Varela, PBA). <br>

Our research in ophthalmology is focused on:

* Segmentation and identification of retinal lesions in fundus photographs using deep learning techniques.
* Computer-assisted diagnosis of retinal diseases using convolutional neural networks.
* Automated identification of novel biomarkers associated to diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.
* Computer-assisted treatment planning of visual diseases using fundus images and optical coherence tomography.
* Automated ICL sizing from anterior segment parameters.

We are also creating [retinar](https://retinar.com.ar/), an AI based telemedicine platform for detecting diabetic retinopathy in communities with limited access to ophthalmologists.
