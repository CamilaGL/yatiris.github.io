From June 18th to 21th 2019, [Eugenia Moris](http://yatiris.github.io/people/eugenia_moris/index.html) and [Santiago Vitale](http://yatiris.github.io/people/santiago_vitale/index.html) will be presenting two abstracts at the international conference CARS 2019 (Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery) in Rennes (France), one of the most important congresses in computer-assisted medicine. Eugenia and Santiago were also selected by [ISCAS](http://www.iscas.net/), the International Society for Computer Aided Surgery,  among participants from all over the world, to get travel support grants to attend the conference. These scholarships are intended to promote the attendance of students from developing countries located far away from Europe, considering also the scientific excellence of their works.

Eugenia is an undergrad student from UNICEN, working in Yatiris with a research training grant from CIN. She will be presenting her research, entitled "Automatic Detection of Morphological Structures in Intravascular Ultrasound images with Convolutional Neural Networks", supervised by Dr. Ignacio Larrabide (PLADEMA-CONICET) and Dr. Lucas Lo Vercio (University of Calgary, Canada). Find her oral presentation [here](http://medialibrary.cars2019.org/mediatheque/media.aspx?mediaId=71012&channel=70776).

Santiago is a PhD. student from CONICET, and he will be presenting a poster describing his current work, namely “Improving Realism in Patient-specific Abdominal Ultrasound Simulation Using CycleGANs”. His research is also supervised by Dr. Larrabide, and counts with the external collaboration of Dr. José Ignacio Orlando (Medical University of Vienna, Austria) and Dr. Emmanuel Iarussi (UTN-FRBA, Argentina). 

Santiago and Eugenia, their advisors and collaborators and Yatiris in general deeply acknowledge ISCAS for granting the attendance to the conference. Participating in such an important conference will bring them a new experience for their personal development as researchers, while aiding to disseminate the results of their investigations in our group.
