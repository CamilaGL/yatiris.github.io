* Automated methods to segment vascular geometries in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital substraction angiography (DSA).
* Hemodynamic simulation algorithms based on arterial geometries, to study the blood flow within the aneurysm.
* Virtual modelling of treatment devices (stents, coils and flow diverters) using computational techniques.
* Simulators for computer-assisted planning of medical treatments and interventions.
