### About us
We are a research group of computer scientists with interest in bringing digital tools to medicine. We are part of Pladema Institute, a multidisciplinary group funded by UNICEN (Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires), CNEA (Comisión Nacional de Energía Atómica) and CIC-PBA (Comisión de Investigaciones Científicas de la Provincia de Buenos Aires). Our laboratory is located at the university campus in Tandil, Argentina, in a brand new building inaugurated in 2017.

### Research
Computers are great, and we use them all the time in many domains. Medicine is of course included in that group. As researchers, we focus in providing new tools for what's called computer-assisted medicine: aiding clinicians and medical scientists in performing their daily tasks, using computational methods to support them. To this end, we develop novel techniques at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning and computer graphics, using biomedical signals and/or images as inputs. 

Our research covers several areas in medicine, including diagnosis and treatment planning of cardiovascular diseases, neuroscience, screening and analysis of retinal diseases, image synthesis and medical imaging in general. You can find further details about our current and ungoing projects in [our projects page](http://yatiris.github.io/our-projects/).


### Lab Members

Our research group is mainly composed of computer scientists and mathematicians, working at the intersection of statistics, physics, biology, applied mathematics, software engineering, machine learning and many other disciplines. Visit our [people page](http://yatiris.github.io/people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab (publications, contact information, photos).
